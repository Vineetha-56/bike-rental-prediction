# 🚲 Bike Rental Demand Prediction

Hi! I'm Vineetha, and this is my machine learning project for the InfoBharat Internship (August 2025). I built a regression model that predicts how many bikes will be rented on a given day based on weather conditions and calendar details.

---

## 📚 About the Project

This project focuses on predicting the demand for bike rentals using the following features:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Weather condition
- Day of the week
- Holiday or not

I used Python with libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to explore the data and build models.

## 📊 Dataset Info

- Source: Publicly available bike sharing datasets (like Kaggle or UCI ML Repository)
- Target column: count (number of bike rentals)
- The dataset includes both weather and date-based features to improve prediction accuracy.

---

## 🔧 Models Used

- Linear Regression (for baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor (for improved performance)

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

To measure how well the models performed, I used:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 💻 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bike-rental-prediction.git
cd bike-rental-prediction

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:



python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3. Install required libraries:



pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code to explore the analysis and model training.
